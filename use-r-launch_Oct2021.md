Hi everyone

The CEEDS R coding group is relaunching on Wednesday October 13th. We have expert demos planned from October 16th through to March 2021 - see below for the next schedule of topics. 

Our use-r group aims to build a coding community and provide support for students and staff at LEC/CEH. Quick recap on how the group works:

**We meet every Wednesday at 12pm on[ Teams](https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/ap/t-59584e83/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fteams.microsoft.com%2Fl%2Fmeetup-join%2F19%3ameeting_MzJjNzIxZGItOGM0Yy00ZGJmLThjMDktMWU1Nzk2MGI0YzUx%40thread.v2%2F0%3Fcontext%3D%7b%22Tid%22%3a%229c9bcd11-977a-4e9c-a9a0-bc734090164a%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%221ca55d23-ca39-4afd-9ed5-c8d1ed24655f%22%7d&data=04|01|james.robinson%40lancaster.ac.uk|7a3d7548f8754f9d550608d911626d52|9c9bcd11977a4e9ca9a0bc734090164a|0|0|637559936694764716|Unknown|TWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D|1000&sdata=8aPRZZki9tB8zKK%2B7YM2vOD%2Bh9VLvkhWp2QUKX2bjBc%3D&reserved=0)** to learn new skills and share R tips

Each month tackles a specific R theme (tidyverse, modelling, data viz) through expert demos and show-and-tell sessions.

We welcome all disciplines and abilities. Our 7 expert organizers are PhD students and research staff across LEC + CEH.

The weekly meetings and Slack channel are a great place to bring your R problems - lots of experienced and friendly R-users ready to help you debug your code. Join the Slack channel [here](https://join.slack.com/t/leccodingands-vcb3119/shared_invite/zt-wjli0aqa-toMUXoKiu5U_6OWH58pnZA)
