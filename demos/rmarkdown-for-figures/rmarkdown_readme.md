#### This folder contains two pdf figures, the R scripts to create them, and a R-markdown file to compile figures into a pdf.

You should be able to download these files and knit the R-markdown file into a pdf. This is easiest in R Studio: check [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for installation and examples.
