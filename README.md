# Welcome to the LEC/CEH use-r Github repo!

This repo stores the R demos and tutorials from our R community. Feel free to use and re-use - head to **[demos](demos)** for all materials. 

**We meet on Teams every Wednesday at 12pm** to demo useful R tricks, to debug our problems, and just to chat. 

*Message James Robinson if you'd like to join the slack channel or get the Teams link.*
